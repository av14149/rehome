RP = Research Point. These will be researched later on.

In between RP and BP answers, BCs (Blueprint Considerations) will be listed. These are products whose quantities and such need to be finalized as the blueprint is being created as they rely on the layout of the units. Unlike RPs/BPs, there are no other references to BCs anywhere in the text. BCs are included in Act ll of the Blueprint Notation document.

BP = Blueprint. These are Research Points that require the design to be finalized before calculations can be completed.

# Constraints

**GREENHOUSE**

Anything crossed out was changed after the change in location in the section Reproductive Assistance & Food Retrieval.

#### *Benefits*

A greenhouse would be of great benefits for both the homeless and the environment.

- Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide) would be converted to oxygen, lowering the impact of Rehome units on climate change.
- A food supply could be grown and sustained with a greenhouse. Biowaste (e.g. leftovers from cooking or a meal, unused ingredients) could be reused during disposal as fertilizer.
- Water would be recycled and even filtered by some of the plants.

#### *Location*

~~Due to real estate concerns, it seems best to situate a garden on the roof of Rehome units. The dense layer of soil and absorption of sunlight would also act as insulation.~~

After a conflict with the Reproductive Assistance & Food Retrieval section, the location has been changed to a raised location inside the unit.

#### *Maintenance*

The plants in a greenhouse need 1) nutrients, 2) water, 3) sunlight, 4) reproductive assistance, and 5) avoidance from predators. Humans require services from the plants including 1) food retrieval, 2) water retrieval, and 3) year-long yields.

**Nutrients**

   Can be provided in soil. If fertilizer is biowaste, the systems for extracting unusable chemicals will require energy and money [RP1].

**Water**

   Can also be provided through soil. ~~This is fairly straightforward: Water filtration systems (discussed later) can be piped upward through walls to the greenhouse and injected into the soil. The pumps moving water upward can also be used with the biowaste to minimize energy and budget consumption [RP2].~~

**Sunlight & Year-Long Yields**

   In order to grow year-round, plants need suitable sunlight and temperatures. ~~To achieve sunlight during the winter with UV lights and maintain temperature throughout the year (with insulation and climate control systems) will require substantial amounts of both money and electricity~~ More information on whether extra UV light will need to be provided needs to be found [~~RP3~~ RP2].

**Reproductive Assistance & Food Retrieval**

   Seeds can be taken out of fruit during consumption and returned to the soil. Food can be plucked from the plants at their peak. However, both of these will require a human on the roof with the greenhouse. Therefore, the location of the greenhouse will need to be changed. A raised surface inside the house (assuming some method of letting light in such as a skylight) would provide numerous more advantages: climate control systems could be integrated with the house [triggering a change in RP3], easy human access to the greenhouse would become viable, and water filtration and biowaste pumps would not have to be installed as the inhabitors of a unit can transfer them to the greenhouse daily.

**Avoidance from Predators** is already guaranteed if the greenhouse is inside a Rehome unit.

**ENERGY**

Immediately at the arrival of this topic, a conflict of interests is reached. The use of wind energy would allow a multi-location advastiontage as well as providing environmental relief, but current systems have exorbitant prices. Therefore, it makes much more sense to have communal power, where a mini-power station provides electricity to a cluster of units. However, the feasibility of wind power is still questionable. Connecting to the grid is unheard of, but solar power may be viable as panels have been lowering in cost in recent years to an acceptable level. Research will be needed to determine one of the sunniest places in the country with high homelessness rates [RP3].

Further research is needed to calculate total energy consumption per unit; afterwards, choosing the number of units per cluster is the last step remaining [BP1]. Formulas have been worked below to the point where you can “plug and chug.”

#### *Solar Panel Providers*

To minimize costs, let us use a fixed-tilt solar panel setup. One option is the 100w [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Grape-Solar-100-Watt-Monocrystalline-Solar-Panel-for-RV-s-Boats-and-12-V-Systems-GS-Star-100W/204211365](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Grape-Solar-100-Watt-Monocrystalline-Solar-Panel-for-RV-s-Boats-and-12-V-Systems-GS-Star-100W/204211365) ($104.38). TurbineGenerator states 5.7 hours per day may be available on average for such panels (using the San Diego location found in RP3). Assuming that the panels are able to operate at 90% of their peak capacity and thus 90W of electricity will be provided per panel, each panel generates 513Wh daily during the sunny hours. However, only a fraction of it should be used during the sunny hours; the rest will be needed for times when the panels are not generating power.Rthis fraction should be directly proportional to the portion of the day the sunny hours occupy. Therefore, about 392Wh of battery storage per panel is needed. For this, we can turn to reliable lithium-ion batteries. (A big problem with lithium-ion batteries is that they require a cool environment. Therefore, the location might be underneath the greenhouse in every home.) Choosing the [https://www.walmart.com/ip/Elfhub-12V-100Ah-Lithium-Battery-1280Wh-LiFePO4-Battery-100A-BMS-Over-5000-Rechargeable-Cycles-Perfect-RV-Camper-Solar-Off-Grid-Boat-Marine-Trolling-/1775771339](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Elfhub-12V-100Ah-Lithium-Battery-1280Wh-LiFePO4-Battery-100A-BMS-Over-5000-Rechargeable-Cycles-Perfect-RV-Camper-Solar-Off-Grid-Boat-Marine-Trolling-/1775771339) ($269) 1280Wh battery, we immediately assume battery degradation to 1200Wh capacity; this also accounts for temperature differences. About three solar panels can store their energy per battery. Now it's time for some math.

$$
\text{cost}_{\text{panel}}=104.38+\frac{269}3 \approx \$195
$$

Each panel generates approximately 513/24=21W of usable energy every day. Therefore, the cost per watt here is going to be about $10 per watt (rounding upwards to the nearest integer for safety).

Let the variable t be the total amount of electricity in watts per unit, and variable c be the number of units per cluster:

$$
tc \cdot \$10 \approx \text{Total budget per cluster.} \\
\frac{t} {21\text{W} \cdot 3 } = \text{Batteries per unit.}
$$

Therefore, the total budget per unit is simple the total energy consumption multiplied by the $10/W ratio.

**COMMON, RECYCLABLE, REUSABLE, AND BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS**

Materials that meet these requirements may include plastic. Although it is not biodegradable, it is recyclable, reusable, and common. Excess can be taken from recycling plants to manufacture units. The price of recycled plastic per volume unit should be factored in [RP4], and the total amount of raw material needed can be multiplied to find the total cost of the building materials for the house [BP2].

# Other Mechanical Systems

**KITCHEN**

A standard kitchen involves 6 main parts:

1. Sink (& drinkable water faucet?)
2. Stovetop
3. Oven / Microwave
4. Refrigerator
5. Dishwasher?
6. Silverware

These all seem very expensive. Therefore, it makes sense to have communal kitchens, maybe two or three to a cluster (depending on the size of clusters; reference [BP1]). Residents can work together to make the food.

All products in [Choosing Adequate Suppliers](craftdocs://open?blockId=6FADC3C0-B6BF-41FF-B276-64E4A3106D79&spaceId=4f3c772b-4e74-68ec-b99c-51704c784999) are including in the Product Specifications & Notations sheet.

**LAUNDRY**

Because of massive costs, it makes sense once again to have communal laundry systems. Let us use the [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/combo/washer-dryer-bundles/510769fd-b0eb-4ce5-8f8d-16dd13abbae1](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/combo/washer-dryer-bundles/510769fd-b0eb-4ce5-8f8d-16dd13abbae1) ($1099.98) set. More details are in the product sheet.

**LIGHTING**

Instead of grafting lights to the interior faces of ceilings (which would be hard anyway with a 3D-printer), lights would best be placed on walls — no needs for mounts, as adhesive will do on the plastic, and wires can be easily routed to the nearest power sources with small grouts made in the walls. I chose the [https://www.1000bulbs.com/product/222122/PLTS-12109.html](https://www.1000bulbs.com/product/222122/PLTS-12109.html) ($0.99) bulb, not counting mounting hardware.

**WATER**

According to the [https://www.sandiego.gov/public-utilities/customer-service/water-and-sewer-rates/water](https://www.sandiego.gov/public-utilities/customer-service/water-and-sewer-rates/water) City of San Diego Public Utilities Department, any amount of water used over 18 HCF (hundred cubic feet, equivalent to 748.05 gallons) is billed at $12.183 per HCF. Therefore, the cost-to-volume ratio is about 61 gallons of water per dollar.

Instead of calculating total water cost (which would be another BP), I will add the costs in the “Cost per Year” section of the Product Specifications & Notations sheet.

*Chance of use & energy/money consumption of UV light systems to keep plants growing year-round.*

> Requires chosen location. This Research Point was completed after the final choice for RP3.

According to the NOAA, average daylight hours in December, January, and February are about 10, 10.5, and 11 hours, respectively. Therefore, it seems unlikely that extra lighting will be necessary.

## RP3: [**ENERGY**](craftdocs://open?blockId=9782EE0C-FF8E-4EC3-9E36-4DC2D04052B0&spaceId=4f3c772b-4e74-68ec-b99c-51704c784999)/

*Suitable location: high sunlight and homelessness rates, preferably with open space to locate the units.*

To make the search easier, I only searched for locations within California.

1. San Diego 7.2/7.4
2. San Jose 6.8/8.2
3. Los Angeles 7.0/7.2

Therefore, it makes the most sense to choose **San Diego** as our initial target location.

## RP4: [COMMON, RECYCLABLE, REUSABLE, AND BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS](craftdocs://open?blockId=45CF3F13-7D7D-42A0-935D-D9DAA63798AD&spaceId=4f3c772b-4e74-68ec-b99c-51704c784999)/

*Price-to-volume ratio of (preferably recycled & biodegradable) plastic.*

If we are to truly solve the problem of homelessness while reducing costs and energy consumption, it makes the most sense to 3D-print the house. No, actually. A single scaled-up 3D printer could print most of the exterior *and* interior walls of the house, even laying out supports for the greenhouse etc. 3D-printing filament can be obtained from multiple sources. Let us use the eco–friendly [https://us.polymaker.com/products/polyterra-pla?variant=39574351282233](https://us.polymaker.com/products/polyterra-pla?variant=39574351282233) ($19.99) filament.

Simple mathematical sleuthing with the easily identifable parameters from the product page and spec sheet ([https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0548/7299/7945/files/PolyTerra_PLA_TDS_V5.1.pdf](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0548/7299/7945/files/PolyTerra_PLA_TDS_V5.1.pdf)) can be used to determine the volume, an essential and the final step towards determining the ratio.

$$
\\ \text{PARAMETERS}
\\ \text{diameter} = 1.75\text{mm}
\\ \text{density} = \frac{1.31\text{g}}{\text{c}^3}
\\ \text{weight} = 1\text{kg}
\\ \text{CALCULATIONS}
\\ \text{volume} \cdot \frac{1.31\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3} = 1\text{kg}
\\ \text{volume} \cdot \frac{1.31\text{g}}{\text{cm^3}} = 1000\text{g}
\\ 
\\ \text{volume} \approx 763.36\text{cm}^3\text{         [ multiply by} \frac{\text{cm}^3}{1.31} \text{ ]}
$$

Considering the cost of $21 (given the 19.99 price seemed to have been given as part of a sale) with this calculation, the ratio of volume to price is about:

$$
\frac{36.35\text{cm}^3}{\$}
$$

Although this does seem very expensive (which it is), buying directly from the manufacturer and printing partially hollow walls will massively decrease the cost of 3D-printing. This will need to be considered after total volumes are finalized and the blueprint is completed [BP3].

# Design Considerations

Ensure to follow these actions as the blueprint is created.

- **COUNT** the number of water pumps needed and add to product list
- **DRAW** blueprint for cluster pods as well
- **LOCATE** lights and note their locations
- **NEVER** consider manufacturing costs!

#### Changes Made During Design Creation

- #### POD CONFIGURATION
   - Moved solar panels on top of kitchen building (which will probably not need climate control as the panels block most sunlight).
   - The building likely will also contain the laundry systems as to include all pod systems in one, large building.
- #### CLIMATE CONTROL
   - Now I feel like a fool for not thinking of this earlier.
