# Rehome
### DESIGNING THE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE OF HOUSING
Beta Version 0.01 (fishfood)

__TO THE NUEVA SCHOOL__
All of this README is important, so please read through it. At the second section, note that whenever you are grading this, Rehome 1.0 may be deprecated and Rehome 2.0 will be completed. If this is the case, look at 2.0, not this dump. If you're looking at this before that happens, then just grade this and laugh at me for my awful work. But thanks for looking at it at all.
## Welcome to ```Rehome```!
```Rehome``` is the collective term used for my endavour to design a housing system that solves the issues of both sustainability and homelessness. In this repository is a collection of ```.md``` and ```PDF``` files that explain my design choices.

## Rehome is not yet completed. It will be in the near future (depending on how you define ```near future```).
Please note that the Rehome project is ongoing. See completed tasks below.

This initial version of Rehome will be archived after completion. Afterwards, I will create a fork for Rehome 2.0, which will have a great deal more details as well as a complete redesign from the ground up. When that happens, I will add a DEPRECATED sign to the top of the README.
